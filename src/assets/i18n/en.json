    "personalStatement": "My name is Mia and I am a software developer based in Newcastle Upon-Tyne. I work for Cambridge University Press and Assessment and I mainly work with Angular and .NET.\n\nI studied at The University of Manchester where I completed an undergraduate degree in history, and then moved on to pursue an MSc in Computer Science at Newcastle University. I have since settled in Newcastle to develop my skills as a software developer.\n\nI am very passionate about learning and continually improving my skills wherever I can. I am eager to learn new topics and have many random hobbies as a result. I speak Esperanto (as you can see from the translations on this webpage!), practice knife flipping, and do needle-felting.\n\nI like to take any opportunity to find out something new and interesting and I hope to continue to further my career as a developer, alongside building my own projects in my spare time\n\nCurrently, I am working on my masters thesis, a project to create a database for international adoptees. During my undergraduate degree, I specialised in cultural history and I really enjoy merging my different interests together and using development for humanitarian purposes.\n\nIf you would like to find out more about my background, you can visit my LinkedIn, Github, or contact me directly at the below links.\nThank you for checking out my website!",
